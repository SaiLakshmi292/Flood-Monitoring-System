-------------------------Problem Statement-----------------------------------

Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters. 
The need for a real-time, low-cost, and easily deployable flood monitoring system is critical, especially in remote or flood-prone areas. 
This project aims to build an IoT-based flood monitoring system using the Raspberry Pi Pico to continuously monitor water levels and send timely alerts to prevent loss of life and property.

-----------------------Scope of the Solution-------------------------------
Real-time water level monitoring using ultrasonic or water level sensors.

Cost-effective and easily deployable in rural and urban flood-prone zones.

IoT-based alerting system through buzzer, SMS (via ESP8266), or mobile notification.

Supports integration with web or cloud services for remote monitoring and data logging.

Expandable to include temperature, rainfall sensors, or GPS.
